# Advanced Programming: NumPy & Matplotlib Analysis (HW2)

This repository contains the solution for Home Assignment 2 in the Advanced Programming course (Shenkar College, IE&M).

The assignment focuses on leveraging the NumPy library for efficient data creation and computation, and Matplotlib for data visualization and exploration.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

* [cite_start]**NumPy Data Manipulation:** Creating, initializing, and analyzing a complex 16x21 matrix representing blood sugar levels[cite: 77].
* [cite_start]**Statistical and Matrix Operations:** Utilizing NumPy for calculating patient and daily averages [cite: 87, 97][cite_start], finding maximum values [cite: 98, 100][cite_start], counting item occurrences [cite: 103][cite_start], and implementing the **Cumulative Sum** (Accumulation Array)[cite: 105, 107].
* [cite_start]**Data Visualization (Matplotlib):** Presenting analysis results using multiple chart types[cite: 115]:
    * [cite_start]**Bar Charts:** Displaying data such as daily average sugar levels and patient average times[cite: 115, 116].
    * [cite_start]**Pie Chart Analysis:** Creating and customizing a Pie Chart with labels, sizes, and an 'explode' effect[cite: 117, 122].
