# Advanced Programming: NumPy & Matplotlib Analysis (HW2)

This repository contains the solution for Home Assignment 2 in the Advanced Programming course (Shenkar College, IE&M).

The assignment focuses on leveraging the NumPy library for efficient data creation and computation, and Matplotlib for data visualization and exploration.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

* **NumPy Data Manipulation:** Creating, initializing, and analyzing a complex 16x21 matrix representing blood sugar levels.
* **Statistical and Matrix Operations:** Utilizing NumPy for calculating patient and daily averages, finding maximum values, counting item occurrences, and implementing the **Cumulative Sum** (Accumulation Array).
* **Data Visualization (Matplotlib):** Presenting analysis results using multiple chart types:
    * **Bar Charts:** Displaying data such as daily average sugar levels and patient average times.
    * **Pie Chart Analysis:** Creating and customizing a Pie Chart with labels, sizes, and an 'explode' effect.

## Repository Content
